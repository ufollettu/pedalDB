## Install dependencies

```
$ yarn
```

## Development

### Start dev server
Starting the dev server also starts MongoDB as a service in a docker container using the compose script at `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

```
$ yarn dev
```
Running the above commands results in 
* üåè**API Server** running at `http://localhost:3000`
* ‚öôÔ∏è**Swagger UI** at `http://localhost:3000/dev/api-docs`
* üõ¢Ô∏è**MongoDB** running at `mongodb://localhost:27017`

## Packaging and Deployment
#### 1. Run with docker-compose

```
$ docker-compose up
```

#### 2. Run with docker

```
$ docker build -t api-server .
$ docker run -t -i -p 3000:3000 api-server
```

#### 3. Build and run

```
$ npm run build && npm run start
```

## Environment
To edit environment variables, create a file with name `.env` and copy the contents from `.env.default` to start with.

## Logging
The application uses [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) as the default logger. The configuration file is at `src/logger.ts`.
* All logs are saved in `./logs` directory and at `/logs` in the docker container.
* The `docker-compose` file has a volume attached to container to expose host directory to the container for writing logs.
* Console messages are prettified
* Each line in error log file is a stringified JSON.
